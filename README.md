# MyProgressWithSwift
A repository about my progress in studying Swift 4 and the projects I do along the way. I began with watching videos by [Chris Chang](https://www.youtube.com/codewithchris) on youtube and quickly got used to the basics. I enjoyed the "type along & learn coding" method and started looking around for udemy courses of which there are plenty! After reading some reviews I chose the [iOS 12 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/) and the value for money you get with this course is just amazing. Thank you [@AngelaYu](https://github.com/angelabauer)!
Long story short, since I started feeling like I am not monitoring my progress properly and I need to write down notes and bits of code that I want to reuse I created this repository. I might not have time to monitor it everyday, but every day that I do some coding I will also make notes here.
